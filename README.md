TFT Set 6 Loaded Die Calculator

This is a Calculator for Teamfight Tactics Set 6 that calculates the odds of getting a chosen unit in a slot in your shopif you use a loaded die on every unit that shares a
trait with it

Executing the file will open up a prompt where you type in the name of your desired unit in lowercase (ex. kaisa, miss fortune, tahm kench, viktor, mundo), and the level that you 
are at (ex. 1, 2, 3, etc). Typing in an invalid input (such as "kaisa ", "KAISA", "Kaisa") will result in the .exe file closing. I would fix this but I'm lazy and in college.
