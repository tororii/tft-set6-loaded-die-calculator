TFT Set 6 Loaded Die Calculator

This is a Calculator for Teamfight Tactics Set 6 that calculates the odds of getting a chosen unit in a slot in your shop if you use a loaded die on every unit that shares a
trait with it

Executing the file will open up a prompt where you type in the name of your desired unit in lowercase (ex. kaisa, miss fortune, tahm kench, viktor, mundo), and the level that you 
are at (ex. 1, 2, 3, etc). Typing in an invalid input (such as "kaisa ", "KAISA", "Kaisa") will result in the .exe file closing. I would fix this but I'm lazy and in college. 

It is pretty janky, and there is 100% better ways to write the code, but whatever it works. 

NOTE: I don't think the odds are 100% correct, but it is an accurate enough estimate. 
      Also, this is the odds of getting the desired unit FOR EACH SLOT IN YOUR SHOP, so the actual odds can be up to 5x that of what the calculator returns.
